# Sensitivity Analysis methods flowchart
An attempt to provide some clarification on sensitivity analysis methods generally used in environmental modeling

## Introduction

Some guidance as to why a specific method should be selected in a certain situation can be helpful. A flowchart is introduced which can be useful as a practical guidance for applying Sensitivity analysis methods. I also added some methods that are generally linked to uncertainty estimation to illustrate the linkage with methods for sensitivity analysis.

It is not a community-wide agreed flowchart or best practice, but purely a guidance proposed as a starting point.  It is mainly driven by practical considerations and for sure prone to discussion. As focus is on the assumptions and type of analysis, I do not provide the computational effort the methods need in the flowchart. The latter is a technical issue and should be solved as such.

## Purpose

The creation of a guideline or a flowchart always provides the risk of making blunt choices and missing essential methods (the scheme is based on a small subset of methods that are well-known). It should be a continuous development, based on insights from continuous work and shared among the community.

So, anyone is invited to clone this repository and propose adaptations to the scheme or just discuss the scheme by adding issues.

By making this scheme publicly accessible on github and adaptable with the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/), the scheme can be adapted by others to include new methods or restructure the scheme. The `flowchart.svg`-file is originally created in the open source software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org). The .svg-extension provides the revision within Github which will enable the tracking of the development as function of time.

## Inspiration

The styling and idea is directly taken from the [version originally created by Andreas Mueller](http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.be/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html) in function of the scikit-learn machine learning package Pedregos et al. (2011).
